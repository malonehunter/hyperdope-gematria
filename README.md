## Getting Started

To learn more about how to use Hyper Calc see the Quickstart Guide in the app under the About menu.

This repo may be cloned as-is to your **web server** for self-hosting your own fully-featured gematira calulator with integrated database matching.

To add more words or phrases to the matching database append them as new lines to the db.txt. To autoload a different properly formatted .txt file you can change the reference in the AUTO LOAD DATABASE (DB) section at the bottom of index.html.

> NOTE: You must run this app from a web server for the word matching database to autoload due to the way browsers handle local file security. Please see [this CORS error article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58879729/access-to-xmlhttprequest-at-file-sample-txt-from-origin-null-blocked-by-c) for more information. A quick way to run db matching offline locally is to open the project folder in VS Code and launch it with the Live Server extension.

If you do not need the auto loading db feature simply download the repo and open index.html.

If you are not interested in using this tool offline or self-hosting and just want to use the tool with the full word matching experience, navigate the project's [official hosted version](https://calc.hyperdope.com).

### Changing the Theme

There are 10 themes packaged with Hyper Calc: black, blue, green, green alt, red charcoal, teal, white, and old book (normal, bright, and dim).

To enable a theme, uncomment the 'AUTO LOAD THEME' script at the bottom of index.html and change the reference to any of the files in the /theme folder.
