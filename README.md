## Getting Started

To learn more about how to use Hyperdope Gematria, see the Quickstart Guide in the app under the About menu.

This repo can be cloned as-is to your **web server** for self-hosting your own fully-featured gematira calulator.

To add more words or phrases to the matching database append them as new lines to the db.txt file.

> NOTE: You must run this app from a web server for the word matching database to autoload due to the way browsers handle local file security.  Please see [this CORS error article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58879729/access-to-xmlhttprequest-at-file-sample-txt-from-origin-null-blocked-by-c) for more information.  A quick way to run db matching offline locally is to open the project folder in VS Code and launch it with the Live Server extension.  

If you do not need the auto loading db feature, simply download the repo and open index.html.
